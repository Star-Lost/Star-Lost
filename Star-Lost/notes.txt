Components hold data, e.g. position, velocity.
Systems perform logic, e.g. collisition detection, velocity

For events we want a "state" component which holds what is happening to an entity, e.g. it's being clicked on with LMB.

We then want a system which, at the beginning of each tick, goes through all entities containing the state component and update it depending on what's happening (being clicked on with LMB)

Then in each system we can check the entity's state component and perform the relevant logic on it. For example if we have a "lamp" system we can check if the lamp is clicked and toggle the power on/off.
